## Data description

### lab.genobaypass and lab.snpdet
**lab.genobaypass** contains read counts for biallelic SNPs in Baypass format
generated using *poolfstat*
**lab.snpdet** contains the reference contig and position for every SNP
in the *genobaypass* file

The data columns are in the following order:
