# Baltic_Lab_Wild
Scripts to execute the analyses for the *E. affinis* Baltic Sea selection
experiment and comparison with wild populations

Primary data processing scripts are in the main directory.
Command-line options for python scripts can be found, e.g.,
`baypass2freqs_cov.py -h`

Other data wrangling and analysis scripts are in the *extra_scripts* directory
and contain limited documentation within.

Functions for calculating parallelism, e.g., Jaccard index are in
`extra_scripts/parallelism_function.R`
